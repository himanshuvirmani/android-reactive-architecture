# AndroidBaseTemplate
Android base template code with clean architecture and major useful 3rd party libraries used in android development.

## Highlights

-  Used [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger) for dependency injection of application level stuff like disk cache volley etc.
 
-  Used [Volley with OkHttp and GSON in-built](https://github.com/himanshuvirmani/android-volley-gson-okhttp). This means you give payload object and receive Response object. All json/pojo(serialisation/deserialisation) is done by the library only.

- Used [Android disk cache](https://github.com/himanshuvirmani/AndroidDiskCache) for caching.

- Code is packaged cleanly and can be extended easily.
